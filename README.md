# BlephAquaduino
Automation of a freshwater aquarium, with an Arduino board.

## Pay attention
This project was made a long time ago, and this code may no longer be operational. Furthermore, this code is really not sexy (3K lines code in one file ...) and not maintainable, but could help people to do the same.

## Description
This was a project maded for managing a freshwater aquarium, and configurable with a touchscreen user interface.
It can:
- manage potential hydrogen (pH) of the water by controlling a solenoid valve on a carbon dioxide cylinder.
- manage a led lighting to match with true cycle of photosynthesis, and true cycle of intensity and wavelenght of the sun rays (sunrise, sunset, moon light etc...).
- manage internal temperature.
- manage the filtration.
- manage the injection of liquide fertilizer with peristaltic pump.
- renew the water with peristaltic pump.
- Feed the fish with diy mechanical feeder.
- All this was configurable in the user interface.

## Hardware
- Arduino MEGA 2560 R3
- Relay cards
- Screen shield
- Touch screen 3.2"
- 18DS20 temperature sensors
- pH probes
- LED drivers PWM capable
- Transformers meanwell SP-24-150
- Heatsink
- 27 LED with specific optics (14 XPG-R5 Cool white with 80° optics, 5 LED Philips rebel ES DEEP RED and 2 LED XPG-R5 RED without optics, 6 LED Philips rebel ES Royal Blue with 80° optics)
